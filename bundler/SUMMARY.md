# Font Previewer Bundler - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've successfully created a C++ project that can bundle the Flutter Windows release build into a single executable file, similar to how Enigma Virtual Box works. The implementation:

- Embeds all required files (EXE, DLLs, assets) as resources
- Extracts them to a temporary location at runtime
- Runs the application from this temporary location
- Cleans up everything when the app exits

## Project Structure

```

## Building and Testing

1. Build the Flutter app in release mode:
   ```
   flutter build windows --release
   ```

2. Build the bundler using one of the provided methods:
   - Run `build_all.bat` (automated)
   - Run `build_manual.bat` (semi-automated)
   - Open `FlutterBundler.sln` in Visual Studio (manual)

3. Test the bundled app:
   - Run `test_bundled_app.bat`
   - Or directly run the output file (`bin\x64\Release\FontPreviewer.exe`)

## Customization

If you need to customize the bundler for another Flutter app:

1. Use `generate_resources.ps1` to generate a new resources.rc file
2. Update `resource_extractor.cpp` to match the new resource IDs
3. Rebuild the bundler

## Limitations

- The temporary files are extracted at runtime, so there is still disk I/O
- Large asset files will increase the size of the executable
- Startup time may be slightly increased due to extraction process

## Future Improvements

Potential improvements for this bundler:

1. Add compression to reduce the final executable size
2. Support command-line arguments to pass to the Flutter app
3. Add a splash screen during extraction for better UX
4. Support extraction to memory instead of disk for smaller apps
5. Add update mechanism for self-updating apps
